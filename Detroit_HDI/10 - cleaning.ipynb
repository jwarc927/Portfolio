    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1950 the population of Detroit was 1,850,000, making it second only to Chicago in the Great Lakes Region of the United States.  It had a robust manufactuing sector which buttressed its position as one of America's leading cities and was considered to be a center of economic and cultural development.  Since then, for many reasons that this project will not specifically explore, Detroit has been in a steady state of decline.  In 2015 its population fell below 680,000, removing it from the top 20 cities in the United States for the first time in 165 years.  As of the 2020 Census, Detroit's population was 639,111, placing it in position 27. Some [research](https://www.milmi.org/_docs/publications/Population_Projections_2045.pdf) suggests that Detroit's population has reached a minimum and there is much effort being spent to revitilize the city in order to make it a more attractive place to live.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "While the overarching problems in Detroit are well known it is not necessarily clear which of these problems are most holding Detroit back.  This project seeks to use county level data collected from every county in the United States to fit a machine learning model to these data and the Human Development Index (HDI) of the county.  This model will then be applied to the specific circumstances of Wayne County, Michigan (of which half of the land area and vast majority of the population are within the city limits of Detroit) in order to determine the top 5 areas of development that concerned individuals in Detorit could focus on to best increase the HDI of the area."
